# Equation Generator

This program generates all valid equations of a fixed character width, for a simple arithmatic language. Equations look like this

```
1+1=2
4*5=20
8*4-2=30
291/3=97
...
```

The language allows for `+-*` and `/`, along with integer constants. This is a basic calculator syntax

## Language details

* Multiplication and Division are evaluated first, going from left to right
* Addition and subtraction are evaluated second, also going left to right
* Fractions do not exist. If two numbers do not evenly divide, the expression is skipped
    * This feels wrong because `3/4=6/8` is obviously true
* While you can create a negative expression using subtraction (like `1-8`) negative constant literals are not allowed (`-7`)

## Verification

Given 

A = the set of all valid calculator expressions (the answer)
P = the set of equations generated by this program

It is pretty easy to use a 3rd party like python to verify P is subset or equal to A

```
cargo run | sed 's/=/==/' | awk '{print "assert "$0}' | python
```

Conversely proving A is subset or equal to P is much harder. 

I think the easiest way would be to prove the size of P = the size of the output of my program (119277 for equations of length 10)
